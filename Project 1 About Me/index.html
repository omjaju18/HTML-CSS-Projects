                and NodeJS, which incorporated Google Authentication and the ability
                to post images and videos.</li>

                Hacking, ReactJS, and C Language. I am always looking to learn and
                explore new technologies, and I believe in constantly upskilling
                myself to stay relevant in this ever-changing industry.</li>
              <li> Apart from my technical expertise, I am also an avid cricket
                fan and enjoy watching movies and web series in my free time. I
                believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance and engaging in
                activities that bring me joy and relaxation.</li>
              <li> As a team player with excellent    communication skills, I am
                confident that I would be a valuable asset to any organization
                looking for a highly motivated and skilled ReactJS Developer and
                Front End Developer. Thank you for considering my profile, and I
